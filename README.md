# Microsoft Sentinel Lab

A cybersecurity project demonstrating Microsoft Sentinel alert triage, incident investigation, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) operations, threat detection, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

---

# Overview

This project demonstrates how Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts use Microsoft Sentinel to investigate security alerts, perform alert triage, correlate security events, prioritize incidents, and document investigation findings.

The lab simulates a Microsoft Sentinel investigation workflow by analyzing security alerts, mapping detections to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and producing professional SOC investigation documentation.

---

# Objectives

* Demonstrate Microsoft Sentinel investigation workflows.
* Perform alert triage and incident prioritization.
* Investigate security alerts and incidents.
* Map detections to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
* Produce professional SOC investigation reports.
* Demonstrate practical SIEM investigation skills expected of SOC Analysts.

---

# Features

## Alert Triage

* Investigates Microsoft Sentinel alerts.
* Identifies suspicious security activity.
* Prioritizes alerts based on severity.

## Incident Investigation

* Correlates security events.
* Assesses incident severity.
* Supports escalation decisions.

## MITRE ATT&CK Analysis

* Maps detections to ATT&CK techniques.
* Documents attacker behaviors.

## Security Reporting

* Produces professional investigation reports.
* Documents findings and response recommendations.

| -------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Brute Force    | T1110     | Credential Access |
| PowerShell     | T1059.001 | Execution         |
| Create Account | T1136     | Persistence       |
| Valid Accounts | T1078     | Defense Evasion   |
